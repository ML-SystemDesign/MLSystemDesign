### **2. Relevance&Reasons**

In this section, we explore the relevance of the problem and the motivation behind developing the chatbot system, supported by a detailed analysis of the current process and the goals we aim to achieve.

**2.1. Problem Definition**

The current method of accessing technical documentation for the operation and maintenance of solar power plant installations is cumbersome and inefficient. Employees face significant challenges in quickly retrieving relevant information, leading to delays in maintenance procedures and increased downtime. The lack of an intuitive and rapid access system means that employees often have to manually search through extensive documentation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.

The absence of a centralized, intelligent system to handle queries and provide precise information from the technical documents exacerbates the problem. This inefficiency not only affects the productivity of the staff but also has the potential to impact the overall performance and reliability of the solar power installations.

**2.2. Goals**

To address these challenges, the development of an intelligent chatbot system aims to streamline the process of accessing technical documentation. The primary goals of this project are:

1. Provide Relevant Answers: The chatbot should deliver accurate and relevant responses based on the information from the technical documentation. This includes understanding and processing user queries in natural language and retrieving pertinent data quickly.

2. Link to Source Material: Each response from the chatbot should include links to the specific sections of the documentation from which the information was retrieved. This ensures that users can verify the information and consult the original documents for further details.

3. Generate Responses in Russian: The chatbot must be capable of generating responses in Russian, catering to the primary language of the company's employees and ensuring clear and effective communication.

By achieving these goals, the chatbot will significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of accessing technical documentation, thereby improving maintenance operations and reducing downtime.


**2.3. Risks**

Despite the clear benefits, there are several risks associated with the implementation of this system:
1. Accuracy of Responses: If the chatbot provides incorrect or incomplete information, it could lead to improper maintenance actions, potentially damaging equipment or causing safety hazards.
2. System Reliability: Any downtime or unavailability of the chatbot system could revert the employees back to the inefficient manual processes, negating the benefits of the system.
3. Model Limitations: The models used (Mistral-nemo-12B or Llama-3-8B) might not handle all queries accurately, especially if they fall outside the trained context or involve highly specific technical details.

**2.4. Cost of Error**

The cost of errors in this system can be significant:
1. Operational Downtime: Incorrect information leading to improper maintenance can cause extended downtime, resulting in lost energy production and revenue.
2. Equipment Damage: Errors in the chatbot’s responses could lead to improper handling of equipment, causing damage that might require expensive repairs or replacements.
3. Safety Hazards: Inaccurate information could result in safety incidents, endangering the lives of employees and leading to potential legal liabilities and reputational damage.


**2.5. Other Considerations** 

In the context of this project, we also consider the future scalability and adaptability of the system. While the initial deployment will focus on cloud-based infrastructure, there are plans to transition to a local setup within the company's premises, ensuring greater control and security over the system.

Additionally, the design and development of this chatbot system open up possibilities for its application in other areas or industries where quick access to technical documentation is crucial. This potential for broader use makes the project even more valuable and justified.
